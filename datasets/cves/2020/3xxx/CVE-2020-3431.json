An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
